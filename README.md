# Claude Code Plugins

[日本語](README.ja.md)

A collection of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugins for development workflow.

## Plugins

### task-tracker

Lightweight task/ticket tracker using TSV files and shell scripts. While Claude Code's [built-in Task List](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode#task-list) automatically manages work steps internally, task-tracker stores tasks in TSV and Markdown files that humans can read and edit directly.

**Features:**
- Human-readable TSV + Markdown format (`.tasks/`)
- Slash commands: `/task-tracker:add`, `/task-tracker:list`, `/task-tracker:show`, `/task-tracker:update`, `/task-tracker:close`
- Categories: `bug`, `improvement`, `task`
- Includes a skill for Claude to automatically track issues found during development

**Usage:**

```
/task-tracker:add Fix login button not responding
/task-tracker:add bug: API returns 500 on empty payload
/task-tracker:list
/task-tracker:list all
/task-tracker:show 1
/task-tracker:update 1 -s "Updated title"
/task-tracker:close 1 Fixed by updating the handler
```

### skill-authoring

Context design framework for Claude Code [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills). Claude's performance depends on the context it receives — this plugin provides principles and workflows for designing skills that give Claude the right information at the right time.

**Core principles:**
- **Context Design** — Control what enters, flows through, and exits each skill's context to maximize Claude's accuracy
- **Execution Pattern Selection** — Choose the optimal isolation level (main session, context:fork, Built-in/Custom SubAgent) for each task
- **Skill Composition** — When multiple agents share domain knowledge, use the `skills` field for Dependency Injection rather than duplicating content or creating fragile cross-references
- **Quality Checklist** — 28-item evaluation across 6 categories (Context Design, Structure, Frontmatter, Content, design.md, Scripts)

**Workflows:**
- **Creation**: Requirements → Pattern Selection → Design → Structure → Implementation → Quality Check → Test
- **Review**: Load → Compare Against Guidelines → Checklist Evaluation → Improvement Proposals → Report

**Usage:**

```
Create a new skill for checking Slack notifications
Review the task-tracker skill
What are the skill authoring guidelines?
```

### checking-oss-release

Checks open source projects for security leaks, privacy issues, and license compliance before release. Can also set up git pre-commit hooks.

**Features:**
- Three modes: Setup (install pre-commit hook), Quick (staged files check), Full (all files audit)
- Secret pattern detection (API keys, private keys, AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, etc.)
- Git email privacy check (noreply enforcement)
- .gitignore coverage validation
- Dependency license compatibility scan with license matrix
- THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES attribution check
- Bundled pre-commit hook script

**Usage:**

```
Run an OSS release check
Setup pre-commit hooks for security
Quick security check on staged files
Full pre-release audit
```

### designing-test-cases

Guides systematic test case design using established testing techniques. Works with any tech stack and is TDD-compatible (test-first, driven by specs and types rather than implementation).

**Features:**
- Two workflows: New test design and existing test review (gap analysis)
- Seven test design techniques: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Null/Undefined Handling, Type Mismatch, State Transition, Combination/Interaction, Error/Exception
- Produces structured test case matrices (technique × input × expected result)
- Detailed technique reference with rules, checklists, and examples

**Usage:**

```
Design test cases for the login function
Are these tests enough? Review test coverage
What boundary values should I test?
```
